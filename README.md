### Theorical Question 14

Do you know how to especify a different classpath ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The Java runtime knows where the class files for the standard system classes are located and can load them as needed. When the interpreter runs a program that wants to use a class named com.davidflanagan.examples.Point, it knows that the code for that class is located in a directory named com/davidflanagan/examples/ and, by default, it “looks” in the current directory for a subdirectory of that name. In order to tell the interpreter to look in locations other
than the current directory, you must use the ­classpath option when invoking the interpreter or set the CLASSPATH environment variable.
