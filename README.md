### Theorical Question 15

Do you know how to especify a different classpath ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The Java runtime knows where the class files for the standard system classes are located and can load them as needed. When the interpreter runs a program that wants to use a class named com.davidflanagan.examples.Point, it knows that the code for that class is located in a directory named com/davidflanagan/examples/ and, by default, it “looks” in the current directory for a subdirectory of that name. In order to tell the interpreter to look in locations other
than the current directory, you must use the ­classpath option when invoking the interpreter or set the CLASSPATH environment variable.

### Theorical Question 17

Can you create java programs outside of classes ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Classes are the most fundamental structural element of all Java programs. You cannot write Java code without defining a class. All Java statements appear within classes, and all methods are implemented within classes.

### Theorical Question 22

Do you understand what data hiding through encapsulation means ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

One of the most important object­oriented techniques we haven’t discussed so far is hiding the data within the class and making it available only through the methods.

If a member of a class is declared with the public modifier, it means that the member is
accessible anywhere the containing class is accessible. This is the least restrictive type of
access control.

If a member of a class is declared private, the member is never accessible, except within
the class itself. This is the most restrictive type of access control.

If a member of a class is declared protected, it is accessible to all classes within the
package (the same as the default package accessibility) and also accessible within the body
of any subclass of the class, regardless of the package in which that subclass is defined.

If a member of a class is not declared with any of these modifiers, it has default access
(sometimes called package access) and it is accessible to code within all classes that are
defined in the same package but inaccessible outside of the package.
