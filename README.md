### Theorical Question 15

Do you know how to especify a different classpath ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The Java runtime knows where the class files for the standard system classes are located and can load them as needed. When the interpreter runs a program that wants to use a class named com.davidflanagan.examples.Point, it knows that the code for that class is located in a directory named com/davidflanagan/examples/ and, by default, it “looks” in the current directory for a subdirectory of that name. In order to tell the interpreter to look in locations other
than the current directory, you must use the ­classpath option when invoking the interpreter or set the CLASSPATH environment variable.

### Theorical Question 17

Can you create java programs outside of classes ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Classes are the most fundamental structural element of all Java programs. You cannot write Java code without defining a class. All Java statements appear within classes, and all methods are implemented within classes.

### Theorical Question 22

Do you understand what data hiding through encapsulation means ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

One of the most important object­oriented techniques we haven’t discussed so far is hiding the data within the class and making it available only through the methods.

If a member of a class is declared with the public modifier, it means that the member is
accessible anywhere the containing class is accessible. This is the least restrictive type of
access control.

If a member of a class is declared private, the member is never accessible, except within
the class itself. This is the most restrictive type of access control.

If a member of a class is declared protected, it is accessible to all classes within the
package (the same as the default package accessibility) and also accessible within the body
of any subclass of the class, regardless of the package in which that subclass is defined.

If a member of a class is not declared with any of these modifiers, it has default access
(sometimes called package access) and it is accessible to code within all classes that are
defined in the same package but inaccessible outside of the package.

### Theorical Question 23

Do you understand why interfaces were created in java ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

We also saw that a Java class can only inherit from a single class. This is quite a big restriction on the kinds of object­oriented programs that we want to build. The designers of Java knew this, but they also wanted to ensure that Java’s approach to object­oriented programming was less complex and error­prone than, for example, that of C++.

The solution that they chose was to introduce the concept of an interface to Java. Like a class, an interface defines a new reference type. As its name implies, an interface is intended to represent only an API—so it provides a description of a type, and the methods (and signatures) that classes that implement that API must provide.

In general, a Java interface does not provide any implementation code for the methods that it
describes. These methods are considered mandatory—any class that wishes to implement the
interface must provide an implementation of these methods.

### Theorical Question 24

Do you understand what are default methods in interface ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Adding new methods to an interface without breaking backward compatibility requires
providing some implementation for the older implementations of the interface so that they can
continue to work. This mechanism is a default method, and it was first added to the platform
in JDK 8.

### Theorical Question 25

Do you know what generics are in java ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

One of the great strengths of the Java platform is the standard library that it ships. It provides a great deal of useful functionality—and in particular robust implementations of common datastructures. These implementations are relatively simple to develop with and are well documented. The libraries are known as the Java Collections. 

Although they were still very useful, the earliest versions of the collections had a fairly major limitation, however. This limitation was that the data structure (sometimes called the container) essentially obscured the type of the data being stored in it.
